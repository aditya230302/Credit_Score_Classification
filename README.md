# Credit_Score_Classification

# Problem Statement:
- You are working as a data scientist in a global finance company. Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts. Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.

# Dataset Information: 
- Credit score dataset contains 1 lac records with 28 features.
